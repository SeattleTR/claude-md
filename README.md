# agent-md

**Archimedes Agent Directives** — cross-agent directives, hooks, and state layout for autonomous coding agents. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider.

Formerly `claude-md` (v1–v3). Now multi-agent and memory-aware.

Honest scope: the markdown directives are advisory (the agent has to read and follow them). Only the Claude Code hooks and the optional `.githooks/pre-commit` actually block anything — see the enforcement table below.

## Quickstart

```bash
# From inside your project directory
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamfakeguru/agent-md/main/install.sh | bash
```

You get:
- `AGENT.md` + per-agent aliases (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `CONVENTIONS.md`)
- `.claude/hooks/` — 7 Claude Code hooks (lint, type-check, tests, state, sensory reminder, TDD nudge, destructive-command block)
- `memory/` — 5-file persistent state system (`agents.md`, `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `verify.md`, `gotchas.md`)
- `skills/` — progressive tool disclosure (agent queries instead of loading all schemas)
- `.githooks/pre-commit` — optional git-hook fallback for any agent (disabled until you enable it)

## The Problem

Coding agents have structural failure modes that compound into hours of lost work:

- They say "Done" when the code doesn't compile
- They lose the codebase mid-refactor (context compacts silently at ~167K tokens)
- They apply band-aid fixes instead of real ones
- They hallucinate after ~15 messages
- They rename functions and miss half the callers
- They have no persistent memory — every session restarts from zero
- They self-grade ("looks good") instead of actually validating

## The Fix — Three Layers

**Markdown directives** (`AGENT.md`) carry judgment-heavy guidance: planning discipline, TDD, multisensory validation, the CRISPY pipeline, the 2.1 step rule. Every supported agent reads the same source of truth. Advisory — depends on the agent following what it read.

**Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`) are where real enforcement lives — for Claude Code. They can block Stop, emit block decisions after edits, and deny destructive Bash calls pre-execution. For non-Claude agents there is an optional `.githooks/pre-commit` that runs on `git commit` — it is installed but NOT active by default (enable with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`).

**Persistent state** (`memory/`) is a 5-file layout. Agents read `agents.md`, `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `verify.md`, `gotchas.md` at session start and update them as work progresses. Chat history isn't memory.

## Enforcement — What actually blocks

| Check | Claude Code | Codex / Cursor / Windsurf / Aider | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lint after edit | **Hard** (`post-edit-verify.sh`) | Fallback via `pre-commit` (opt-in) | Per-file eslint/ruff |
| Type-check + lint + tests at Stop | **Hard** (`stop-verify.sh`) | Fallback via `pre-commit` (opt-in) | Uses heuristic tool detection |
| `progress.md` stays current | **Hard** (`state-enforcement.sh`) | Fallback via `pre-commit` (opt-in) | Staged diff check |
| Destructive Bash blocked | **Hard** (`block-destructive.sh`) | Not covered | Regex seatbelt, not a security boundary |
| UI → visual validation | **Advisory** (`sensory-reminder.sh`) | Advisory via `AGENT.md` | Injects reminder, does not run Playwright/VLM itself |
| New export → matching test | **Advisory** (`tdd-check.sh`) | Advisory via `AGENT.md` | Grep-based nudge |
| Tool-output truncation | **Advisory** (`truncation-check.sh`) | Not covered | Looks for "Output too large" marker |
| Planning / CRISPY / 2.1 / memory reads | Advisory (`AGENT.md`) | Advisory (`AGENT.md`) | Depends on agent following the file |

"Hard" = the hook can block the agent or commit. "Advisory" = it only injects a reminder the agent may still ignore. "Fallback" = runs on `git commit` if the user ran `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Install Options

```bash
# Auto-detect all agents (default)
./install.sh /path/to/project

# Specific agent(s)
./install.sh --agent=claude /path/to/project
./install.sh --agent=codex,cursor .

# Skip git hooks prompt
./install.sh --no-githooks .
./install.sh --githooks .
```

Required: `jq` (Claude Code hook JSON parsing), `git`, and your language's toolchain.

## What It Fixes

| Problem | Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| "Done" with 40 type errors | hooks + .githooks | `stop-verify` / `pre-commit` blocks completion until tsc/eslint/tests pass |
| Lint errors accumulate across edits | hooks | `post-edit-verify` runs lint per file write |
| `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `.env` exfil | hooks | `block-destructive` denies before execution |
| Grep finds 3 results; there are 47 | hooks | `truncation-check` warns when output was cut |
| No memory between sessions | memory/ | 5-file state system read/written each session |
| Completion without progress update | hooks + .githooks | `state-enforcement` blocks Stop unless `progress.md` changed |
| UI bugs that pass type-check | hooks | `sensory-reminder` nudges agent to screenshot + VLM review |
| Implementation without a test | hooks | `tdd-check` soft-warns on new exports without matching tests |
| Tool schema bloat | skills/ | `discover_tools` queries skills on-demand |
| Band-aid fixes | AGENT.md | Senior dev override directive |
| Context decay on large refactors | AGENT.md | Sub-agent swarming directive |
| Rename misses dynamic imports | AGENT.md | Grep-is-not-AST rule + reference-type checklist |
| Agent builds before understanding | AGENT.md | CRISPY 200-line spec before code |
| Outrunning headlights | AGENT.md | 2.1 rule — max 1-3 atomic steps per turn |
| Self-grading UI ("looks right") | AGENT.md + hook | Independent verification required |

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Reads | Native hooks? | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Yes — `.claude/hooks/` | — |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `AGENTS.md` | No | `.githooks/pre-commit` (opt-in) |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | No | `.githooks/pre-commit` (opt-in) |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | No | `.githooks/pre-commit` (opt-in) |
| Aider | `CONVENTIONS.md` | No | `.githooks/pre-commit` (opt-in) |
| Any other | `AGENT.md` (if configured) | No | `.githooks/pre-commit` (opt-in) |

Aliases are plain copies of `AGENT.md`, not symlinks (Windows-safe). If you edit one, re-run `./install.sh` to re-sync the others — or edit `AGENT.md` and re-run.

## Migrating from `claude-md` v3

Your existing setup remains compatible:
- GitHub's automatic redirect handles old `iamfakeguru/claude-md` URLs
- Existing `CLAUDE.md` is backed up to `CLAUDE.md.bak` before install writes the new one
- `.claude/hooks/` gains three new hooks alongside the four v3 ones
- `install.sh --agent=claude` reproduces the v3 subset if you want to stay minimal

Re-run `./install.sh` to pick up v4 features.

## Philosophy — The Physics / Topography Split

Hooks are **physics** — inescapable, mechanical, unbypassable under context pressure. They enforce what can be mechanically checked: did it compile, lint, pass tests, did `progress.md` get updated, was a screenshot taken.

Markdown is **topography** — the terrain the agent navigates. It carries intent, strategy, and taste. It can be forgotten under context pressure, but the 4-file memory system provides a persistent surface that survives compaction.

**Rule of thumb:** if an instruction can be forgotten or rationalized away, it belongs in a hook. Everything else goes in markdown. If it's in markdown, call it advisory — don't dress it up as enforcement.

## What This Doesn't Fix

- **Context compaction** still fires at ~167K tokens in Claude Code. The `memory/` system mitigates it (state survives compaction) but doesn't prevent it.
- **Provider-specific quirks** — Codex, Cursor, etc. have their own context windows and compaction heuristics. Directives are cross-stack; enforcement quality varies.
- **Model taste** — models still lack judgment in edge cases. That's why the human reviews the 200-line spec, not the 5,000-line PR.

## Development

Run the test suite:

```bash
bats tests/
shellcheck .claude/hooks/*.sh skills/*.sh .githooks/pre-commit install.sh
```

CI (GitHub Actions) runs both plus an installer smoke test on every push.
